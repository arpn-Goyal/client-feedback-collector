# 🎯 Client Feedback Collector

> A scalable, full-stack MERN application to collect rich, structured feedback from clients — with file uploads, emoji reactions, and version control.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Client Feedback Collector** enables freelancers, designers, and product teams to share feedback forms via secure links without requiring client login. It supports text input, file uploads, emoji sentiment reactions, and tracks changes across multiple versions of feedback.

Designed with production-grade backend architecture and real-world scalability in mind.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔗 Shareable Link System
- Unique token-based URLs per feedback form
- Expiry logic, unauthorized access protection
- Tokens regenerated per version for isolation

### 📋 Structured Feedback Forms
- Dynamic form builder (React-based)
- Stores structured data as JSON in MongoDB

### 😊 Emoji Reactions
- Emoji picker integrated on frontend
- Stores emoji reactions as subdocuments in feedback schema

### 📁 File Uploads
- File attachments via Dropzone + Multer
- Backend support for AWS S3 or Cloudinary
- Signed URLs for secure access and previews

### 🔄 Version Control
- Track changes across different feedback cycles
- Assign version IDs to feedback and attachments
- View feedback diffs between versions (planned)

## 🧱 Engineering Principles

- **Modular Codebase**: MVC-style structure (`routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, `services/`)
- **Security**: Helmet, express-validator, xss-clean, JWT auth
- **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` for spam protection
- **Logging & Monitoring**: `winston`, `morgan`, optional Sentry
- **API Documentation**: Swagger or Postman collection included

---

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Unit Tests: `Jest`, `Supertest` for backend APIs
- ✅ Frontend Tests: React Testing Library
- ✅ E2E Tests: `Cypress`
- ✅ CI/CD: GitHub Actions configured for automated testing & deploy

## 📈 Scalability Patterns

| Domain           | Strategy                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Database**     | MongoDB Atlas with indexing + optional sharding                      |
| **App Scaling**  | Docker containers, NGINX reverse proxy, Kubernetes-ready architecture|
| **File Storage** | CDN-enabled (S3 + CloudFront or Cloudinary w/ caching)               |
| **Caching**      | Redis for hot queries (reaction counts, form templates)              |
| **Background Jobs** | BullMQ or RabbitMQ for image processing, file scanning, etc.     |
